READING NOTES

Reading actively is critical, but commercial word-processing or web-based note taking tools can be distracting. This is a simple tool that manages quotations and reading notes from the command line.


SETUP

First run config.py in whichever directory you want to install to. This creates 3 files:

- A sqlite database
- book_state.txt
- config.txt

The book search feature interacts with the Goodreads API. You'll need an API key for access. If you have one, copy it in the appropriate place in config.txt. If you don't, head to http://www.goodreads.com/api.
